Sweather is a lightweight and less dependencies widget that compatible with desktop OSs, which is made by Svelte and Electron and almost everything is made manually. The weather data-source are from [Free Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## Why Svelte & Tauri

Svelte and Tauri have gained prominence in recent years for their superior performance and reduced memory consumption compared to competitor like Electron. While C# or Swift platforms have the greatest performance and support on Windows and macOS, but cross-platform technologies is more effective especially for frontend developers like me.

This project, being a small to medium-sized multi-platform application, aligns well with the benefits of Svelte and Tauri. In most small-scale projects, Svelte demonstrates better performance than Vue 3. Similarly, Tauri offers a performance advantage over Electron.

By using Svelte and Tauri we can take the following advantages over other cross-platform technologies.

- Better performance

- Less memory use

- Less bundle size

- More support on modern web development

## About TDD(Test Driven Development)

This project is my first [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) project, which is used Vitest for Unit Testing and Playwright for Visual or Behavior Component Testing. In contrary and in my opinion, I do not think TDD is so much important in small business just because that could fussing too much time to write testing code especially to small and middle project and personal project or something. But in a scalable project that scaled enough I will likely and prefer to write testing code for this huge project that probably change functionalities in forthcoming future, so I made this project and wrote testing code for it.
